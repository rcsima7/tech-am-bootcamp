# Event listeners

Now that we know how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, it's time to tie it all together by making this workflow happen with our code:

> User clicks a button --> A block of our JavaScript code is run --> Changes something on the page

For this exercise, open index.html in the browser and write your code in main.js.

#### Instructions

1. Write code that enables a user to change the colour of __box1__ to "salmon" colour by clicking on the "Change colour" button.
    * __Hint__: You will need to use `addEventListener` and write the code in the function that will be called whenever the 'click' event happens on the button.
2. Now, write code that enables a user to increase the width of __box2__ by 20px with each click of the "Increase width" button.

#### Bonus

Further challenges:

1. Modify the logic of "Change colour" so that it changes box1's background to a random colour (perhaps out of a list of 10 predefined colours).
2. Write code that will enable a user to click the key 'c' on their keyboard to trigger a background colour change in box1.
3. Implement a Reset button that will change both boxes to their original state.
