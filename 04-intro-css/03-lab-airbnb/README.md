# Airbnb Mockup

Lots of websites, including Facebook and Airbnb, use a grid layout to display common elements, such as information cards, photos, and other information. The best way to learn how to create these different layouts is to try them ourselves. So let's try recreating a portion of [Airbnb's website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

## Getting Started
* Pull the latest changes of the bootcamp repo
* Copy this folder out onto your desktop and work from the copy
* A HTML file (`index.html`) and CSS file (`css/style.css`) have been created for you. Content is also provided in a folder called `img`

## Requirements
* Look at the deliverable screenshot and see how well you can match it.
* Keep the following in mind when recreating the screenshot
  * Use the right font
  * Obtain and use relevant images
  * Align the text in the center of each image
  * Align the images in the center of each page
  * Think of the layout in terms of rows and columns

## Deliverable

Here's a screenshot of the portion that should be replicated. Deliver the mockup as close as possible. In addition, code should be well-indented and follow best practices.

## Hints

* Before writing any HTML, sketch out the major divs you will need to create this layout first
* You will need to use the `display` property a lot in order to create the multi-column layout
* You will need to use the `position` property to put the text in the middle of the images
* Useful HTML elements for this lab (remember, there are many ways to achieve the same outcome with HTML and CSS):
  * div
  * span
  * img
  * button
* Useful CSS properties:
  * margin (eg. `margin: 0 auto;` to centralise blocks)
  * padding
  * font-size
  * font-family
  * width
  * background-image
