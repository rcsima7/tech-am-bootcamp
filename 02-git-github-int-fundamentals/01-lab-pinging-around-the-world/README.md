# Pinging Around the World

#### Use the `ping` command to see how long it takes for servers to respond to your computer:

All requests sent from your computer must travel across the internet, going
through various servers, in order to make the delivery. Using the `ping`
command in the terminal window, try to find servers that respond quickly, and
find some that take longer to respond. Hit `CTRL + C` if you need to exit
`ping`.

**What are the fastest and slowest sites you can ping?**

> University servers are usually hosted on their actual campuses. Use
> university servers to estimate how long it takes requests to travel around
> the world. Look up the distance between cities and calculate kilometers / time in
> milliseconds to calculate how fast these requests travel.

##### Mystery IP Address

Ping this specific IP address and see how long it takes the server to respond.

Google this IP to find out what makes it unique. Be sure to use the Google
homepage. IP addresses are hard to quick-search from your browser's location
bar! If you type in an IP address your browser will try to load it as if it
were a web page!

#### Experiment with the traceroute command to see how internet traffic flows between your computer and servers:

```
# the traceroute command will show which servers routed the traffic
traceroute washington.edu
```

#### Experiment with cURL and send requests to various web pages. Here are some

useful flags you can use:

##### Headers flag

```
# -I returns the response headers only
curl -I http://www.google.com
```

##### Sample Output

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 27 Sep 2015 02:28:12 GMT
Expires: -1
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
...
```

##### Verbose mode

```
# -v is verbose mode and returns the entire request and response (along with some additional info)
curl -v http://www.google.com
```

##### Sample Output

```
* Rebuilt URL to: http://www.google.com/
*   Trying 2607:f8b0:400a:806::2004...
* Connected to www.google.com (2607:f8b0:400a:806::2004) port 80 (#0)
...
```

#### Using cURL and the `-I` flag, get the following response codes from some webpages:

* 2xx - examples include 200 (OK), 201 (Created)
* 3xx - examples include 301 (Moved permanently)
* 4xx - examples include 400 (Bad request), 404 (Not found)
