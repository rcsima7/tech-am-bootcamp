# Lab 3
# Create your first branch and pull request

1. Go into a directory where you want the repository to appear, and clone this repository: https://github.com/nickangtc/fake-codebase 
2. On your local machine:
- Create a new branch called “YOURNAME-feature” - eg. bob-feature
- Change to work on this new branch so that commits are added only to this branch
- Open the directory in VS Code
- Edit index.html file and add your name between one of the <li></li>, save
- Add the change and commit it with a logical commit message
3. Push your change to the remote repo (Note: don’t push to master! → git push origin [your-branch-name])
4. Create a pull request on GitHub

## Notes
For this lab, you will be added as “collaborators” on a repository, so that you can push changes to the repository and create Pull requests

## Reka's Solution:
Solution is outside of this repo. Pushed to https://github.com/nickangtc/fake-codebase on branch 'Reka2-fature'

## Reka's Notes:
Delete branch locally
git branch -d [branch-name]
Only possible if you're not on the branch atm
