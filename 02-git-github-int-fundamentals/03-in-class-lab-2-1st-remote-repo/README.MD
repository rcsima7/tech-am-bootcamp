# Lab 2
# Working with your first remote repository on GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
Settings: public type, don’t initialise with README, name “my-first-git-repo”
2. Change your working directory in Terminal to my-first-git-repo, which you created in the lab earlier today
3. Run the following commands (copy-pasted from GitHub’s instructions):
git remote add origin https://github.com/INSERT_YOUR_USERNAME/my-first-git-repo.git
git push -u origin master
4. Go back to the GitHub repository you just created and hit refresh → you will see your file there, along with your commit!
