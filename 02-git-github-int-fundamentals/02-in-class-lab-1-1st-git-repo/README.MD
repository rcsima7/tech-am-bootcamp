# In Class Lab 1
# Working with your first Git repository

1. Create a new directory called “my-first-git-repo”, and tell Git to init to start tracking changes

2. Create a new file inside my-first-git-repo and name it README.md

3. Open my-first-git-repo in VS Code, and edit the README.md to contain “Hello, world!”

4. Add and commit the change to Git with the message “This is my first commit, ever”

5. Edit README.md again, this time:
    Add “# my-first-git-repo” as the first line in the file
    Remove the comma from “Hello, world!” to “Hello world!”

6. Tell Git to show you the difference in the README.md file, so you can see its “diffing” algorithm in action

7. Run a single Git command to discard all recent changes, so you’re back to where your last commit is

## Note

Strive to do everything from within Terminal - we will use Git exclusively via the Terminal, so best to get used to it!
You can assume you need to save the file after edits.

## Reka's Solution:
Hello, world!

The repo in this lab is the original 'tech-am-bootcamp'
Decided not to init a new repo inside this folder named my-first-git-repo
It's not recommended to hist a repo inside a repo
Commits from this lab will be added to the master branch, tagged:
Lesson2: In-class-lab1
