# Odd or even program

Write a program that will take in any number and output whether it is an odd or even number.

#### Instructions 

1. Open main.js in VS Code
2. Open index.html in Chrome
3. Write conditionals in main.js so that:
    - if the input is odd, it alerts “Hmm, that is odd!” 
    - If the input is even, it alerts “Okay, we are even.” 
4. Test your program on the browser so you know it works (by changing your input)
